In the first week, I was assigned the task of upgrading the dependencies of Voyagar repo to the latest version.  Because the current project I am working on, dubbed Scalable Voyager, is an enhancement project of the original project Voyager, it needs refinement.  Surprisingly, the original repo is very old (made around 2016) and there are so many dependencies that are outdated in the repo at the moment, so I think it would take a lot of time to patch them all up.
