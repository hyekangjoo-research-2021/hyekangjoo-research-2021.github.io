title: Week 3

Every week, Dr. Battle assigns a paper to read to the Voyager team.  After reading through the paper, we need to brainstorm and write a summary of the key takeaways from the paper, and we review it altogether in the following meeting.  This week, we were assigned a paper on database optimization tool, dubbed [Khameleon](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.07858.pdf).  

In general, interactive data visualization and exploration (DVE) applications suffer from network delays a lot.  Thus, generally, a technique called prefetching is used.  Prefeteching is an action of caching the responses for predicted requests beforehand.  Khameleon also is a frame that uses prefetching mechanism, but it "continuously and aggressively hedges across a large set of potential requests" and "shields developers from joint optimization problem" according to [Mohammed et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.07858.pdf)

Also, all of the dependencies that I have updated need to be merged with the master branch of [Voyager repository](https://github.com/vega/voyager), so I was asked to make a pull request.  Because the process of updating outdated dependencies is very complicated, there are not that many dependencies that I updated to the latest version.  I might discuss the dependencies as one of the achievements during this DREU program since this also taught me more about Git and GitHub, such as GitHub Actions.
